# Eva 
Eva is just a utility eval bot, that has some use for Dyno Bot Support via a few commands that only the staff team normally have access to. They are: 
- `!prod [serverid]` (shows the shard/cluster information for a guild)
- `!cluster [cluster number]` (shows specific information on the cluster provided)
- `!status` (lists the status of each dyno server)
- `!server [server name]` (lists specific information for the provided Dyno server)
- `!prem [server id]` (shows the shard/cluster information for a premium guild)
- `!premstatus` (shows the status of premium)
